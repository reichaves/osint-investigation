A structured OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) skill for Claude, tailored to investigative journalists. Grounded in the **Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations** and Bellingcat-style verification workflows.

---

## What this skill does

This skill turns Claude into a structured OSINT investigator. It covers four core investigation types — image/video geolocation, photo verification, person/entity profiling, and social media account investigation — and always produces a **lead sheet** the reporter can act on.

It is **not** a substitute for primary-source reporting — it produces *leads*, with honest confidence levels, that the journalist must confirm.

---

## Installation

Install via the [`claude-skills`](https://github.com/jamditis/claude-skills-journalism) plugin, or manually:

```bash
# Manual install — clone into your Claude skills directory
git clone https://github.com/reichaves/osint-investigation \
  ~/.claude/skills/osint-investigation
```

Claude Code will automatically discover and load the skill from `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Investigation types

| Type | Trigger phrases | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Geolocation** | "where was this taken", "geolocate", "que cidade é essa" | `references/geolocation-framework.md` |
| **Photo/video verification** | "is this real", "when was this taken", "essa foto é verdadeira" | `references/verification-checklist.md` |
| **Person/entity profiling** | "who is X", "due diligence", "perfil de risco de [empresa]" | `references/entity-profiling.md` |
| **Social media account** | "is this a bot", "who runs this", "investigar essa conta" | `references/social-account-investigation.md` |

---

## Critical guardrails

1. **Never claim certainty without triangulation.** High confidence requires ≥3 independent converging clues.
2. **Never invent evidence.** If a tool is unavailable, say so — do not fabricate matches.
3. **Never identify private individuals** without explicit journalistic justification.
4. **Always include ethical warnings** (verbatim) at the top and bottom of every lead sheet.
5. **Preserve, do not just analyse.** Archive sources (archive.org, archive.today) before analysis.
6. **Vicarious trauma is real.** Offer content warnings for graphic material.

---

## Output — the lead sheet

Every investigation ends in a structured **lead sheet** (template at `assets/lead-sheet-template.md`), bilingual (PT-BR / EN), with:

1. Ethical warning (mandatory)
2. Executive summary
3. Metadata summary
4. Observable clues
5. Candidate findings with confidence ratings (High / Medium / Low)
6. Confidence rationale
7. Visual and documentary evidence links
8. Follow-up questions for the journalist (concrete, actionable)
9. Sources consulted
10. Limitations
11. Closing disclaimer (mandatory)

## Brazilian investigations

For stories involving Brazilian people, companies, or events, the skill also loads `references/brazil-osint-resources.md`, which covers:

- Receita Federal (CNPJ), state commercial registries
- Portal da Transparência, CEIS/CEPIM/CNEP sanctions lists
- JusBrasil, TSE (DivulgaCandContas), CNJ
- IBAMA, ICMBio, MapBiomas, INPE/DETER
- PNCP (public procurement), Câmara and Senado open APIs
- CruzaGrafos, Brasil.IO, Querido Diário, Achados e Pedidos

---

## Ethics

This skill is for **investigative journalism in the public interest**. It will refuse requests that:

- Target minors
- Seek real-time location of any individual
- Target private individuals without journalistic justification
- Appear designed for harassment, stalking, or doxxing
- Assist surveillance against civil society

See `references/ethics-and-safety.md` for full ethical, legal, and operational-security guidance.
